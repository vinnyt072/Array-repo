## About me
I build reliable, maintainable software that people enjoy using. I focus on pragmatic engineering: shipping features that solve real problems while keeping code understandable and testable. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams and mentoring others.

-  I’m currently working on: meaningful projects that move the needle
-  I’m looking to collaborate on: open-source tools, developer tooling, and web/mobile apps
-  I’m learning: scalable architecture, observability, and advanced testing strategies
-  Ask me about: systems design, debugging, testing, and developer ergonomics
-  Fun fact: I love turning complex problems into simple, delightful UX
